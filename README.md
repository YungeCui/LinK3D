LinK3D is develped for the real-time 3D feature extraction and matching of LiDAR point cloud, which generates accurate point-to-point matching results in real time. The core idea of LinK3D is derived from a very simple principle: representing the current keypoint with its neighboring keypoints. The LinK3D descriptor is represented by a 180-dimensional vector. It can be potentially extended to 3D registration and LiDAR odometry, and it also can be used to real-time place recognition and full 6-DoF loop correction in 3D LiDAR SLAM.
